# gedmap
Web application for easy uploading, storing and showcasing your family tree based on GEDCOM files.

I keep this project mainly for tracking my web development learning path, but I genuinely think it looks not too bad - I put some time in UI/UX design thanks to [Sarah Dranser's "Design for developers" masterclass](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-for-developers/).

## Usage
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

## Main page
As a learning exercise I tried to manipulate DOM and implement states HTML objects without any React-like library - only with pure JavaScript and CSS. It makes you think how tedious this work can be without modern web development frameworks.

## Tree viewer
At the moment this is a preview version. Registration, logging in, creating new genograms and many other tools are not available yet. I do not own rights to use GoJS for production use, this is a non-profit project.
